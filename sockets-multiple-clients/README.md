# Multiple Clients

This socket programming tutorial from [Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QiPPX-KeSc&t=614s) will show you how to connect multiple clients to a server using python 3 sockets. It covers how to send messages from clients to server and from server to clients. It will also show you how to host your socket server locally or globally across the internet so anyone can connect. This uses the python 3 socket and threading module.
